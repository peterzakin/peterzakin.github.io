    <h1>Looking ahead to 2025</h1>
        <p class='date'>Dec 8 2024</p>

    <p>
        As the year draws to a close, I've outlined various areas of interest. Some of this is a request for startups. Some of it is merely cleaning out space in my mind for hopefully better ideas.
        
    </p>

    
    <h3>Agents? Where we’re going, we don’t (always) need agents…</h3>

    <p>At the horizon of AI progress, I think some business functions–rather than being automated–can be eliminated entirely.</p>

    <p>What if the end-state of customer support software isn’t replacing humans with agents? What if instead, the future of customer support is just more powerful, more malleable software? Yes, I could call Delta or email Delta for some request (from simple tasks like flight changes to complex tasks like PNR splitting, bereavement fares etc…)... but I could also just get what I need from a more powerful version of the Delta app.</p>

    <p>The whole premise of customer support is that it’s the backstop for activities that couldn’t be properly represented within the normal customer touchpoint (e.g., the app). At some point of AI progress, I think our software becomes sufficiently intelligent that we no longer require the backstop. The software–in more ways than one–should speak for itself.</p>

    <p>A few directions of work that I’m interested in:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Building tools that can help business applications handle long-tail customer needs. This might look like next-gen CommandBar. Or from a different angle, what would Intercom look like in an AI-first world? Or maybe the winning approach strikes at more fundamental product architecture.</li>
        <li>How can apps better anticipate user needs so that problems can be handled proactively?</li>
        <li>What are business processes that, rather than being automated with agents, can actually be obviated through a new way of doing things.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Readying the world for agent employees</h3>

    <p>Here’s one vision for the AI employee: we equip an agent with an email address, a Slack account, and access to various tools. Use of those tools is mediated through APIs or where necessary, computer-use capabilities. Properly equipped with all the necessary tools and having ingested all relevant documents and data sources, the agent is like a remote employee: despite a lack of physical presence, you can discuss business problems and route various tasks for them to fulfill…</p>

    <p>My prediction is that at some point, OpenAI releases an agent employee (I assume this is not <a href='https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-13/openai-nears-launch-of-ai-agents-to-automate-tasks-for-users'>Operator</a>) product with a small set of high-profile partners (e.g., Linear, Atlassian, GitHub, Notion, Slack etc…). These partners would introduce agents as a new user type and conform to some standard protocol for agents that handles authentication, notifications etc…. Agent employees would be able to receive task assignments, @-mentions. They could comment on your documents, produce their own, respond in-line to user feedback etc…</p>

    <p>A few quick thoughts, questions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I’m not sure if agent employees are the most useful approach to AI collaboration, but I think it’s the most likely path of adoption.</li>
        <li>There will be a backlash. As a law of technopolitics, we should expect that power-enriching efforts from tech hegemons will provoke a populistic (often open source) revolt.</li>
        <li>How will customers instruct the behavior of these agents? The tools that developers used to manage the deployment of products built on models will probably mirror the tools that customers use to manage this new source of labor.</li>
        <li>The best customer experiences will require that application developers cater to the needs of this new user type. Just as it became common for companies to expose APIs for developers, I predict we will see companies invest in tooling that helps their customers get the most use of their own agent employees.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Open source business systems</h3>

    <p>We are already seeing a rush among startups to build business systems for AI agents.</p>

    <p>My sense is that in the long run, customers are best served by open source business systems. There are two main reasons for this:</p>

    <ul>
    <li><strong>Agent neutrality</strong></li>
    <p>Closed providers want to sell their own agent labor and will be disincentivized from platforming 3p agents. In contrast, open source systems would inherently be agent-neutral. Users of open source systems would be able to use whichever agents are best suited to their needs optimizing for quality, cost, control etc…</p>

    <li><strong>Customizability</strong></li>
    <p>More and more companies are reporting a desire to build their own custom solutions rather than pay for expensive SaaS. In part this reflects the fact that it is getting drastically easier to build software. But this also reflects a long-standing desire for custom software. Open systems being forkable means that customers have flexibility to rework tools to conform to their unique requirements.</p>        
    </ul>

    <p>I’ve started tinkering here with a side project, but my days as a founder are behind me: I would much prefer to invest in this space!</p>

    <h3>A few final items:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>UI component systems:</strong> The text-to-app modality is fine for a general audience, but I’d like finer-grain control over my generated components.</li>
        <li><strong>Verticalized coding agents:</strong> I think there will be many successful coding agent companies spanning various verticals, particularly those that require their own particular infrastructure/unique toolchain. Game generation, SAP ABAP and other business systems with proprietary programming languages, COBOL etc…</li>
        <li><strong>Do not compete with Cursor by building a copycat:</strong> I think most would-be Cursor killers face an uphill climb by building products that are practically indistinguishable. If you want to build a Cursor competitor, I think it’s best to focus on product differentiation. I’d assume that the design space for new ways of approaching code editing is far richer than has been explored. The entry point might not even be an IDE. It might be helping engineers write architecture documents or PMs/designers drafting better user stories…</li>
        <li><strong>AGI is relative:</strong> My definition of AGI is an AI system that can outcompete the labor output of a single person. This definition is relative. Labor markets vary. We might get AGI that can replace customer support workers before we get AGI that can replace software engineers.The AGI threshold might also vary by company (unique labor-market conditions, nature of the work etc…). Your average startup might find that they can replace their software engineers with AI substitutes before Google does.</li>
        <li><strong>Beating a dead horse:</strong> still pretty bullish on ideas from <a href="https://www.peterzakin.com/beyond-the-web.html">https://www.peterzakin.com/beyond-the-web.html</a>, <a href="https://www.peterzakin.com/consumer_ai.html">https://www.peterzakin.com/consumer_ai.html</a>, <a href="https://pzakin.substack.com/p/dev-first-software">https://pzakin.substack.com/p/dev-first-software</a>, and <a href="https://pzakin.substack.com/p/creative-machines">https://pzakin.substack.com/p/creative-machines</a>.</li>
