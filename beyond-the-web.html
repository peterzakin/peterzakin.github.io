    <h1>Beyond the web</h1>
    <h2>How does AI shape the future of the browser?</h2>
    <p>One view is that we’ll have a browser “copilot”. This would do web-specific things like fill out forms, summarize page content, and remember things we’ve seen before. Presumably, it would also be general purpose like ChatGPT or Claude. In all likelihood, the assistant would just be ChatGPT or Claude.</p>
    <p>The browser is probably going to be a battleground for assistant products. There’s no reason to go to chat.openai.com if there’s an equivalently useful assistant immediately present in your browser window. For this reason, I suspect OpenAI/Anthropic ends up building or buying up their own browser product (perhaps the one from NY).</p>
    <p>In any case, I find the vision of a built-in browser assistant pretty underwhelming. It’s fine and good, and I’ll use the heck out of it. But I can’t shake the feeling that we have the potential to build something significantly more meaningful than this. Something that goes beyond chatbots, semantic search, and browser RPA.</p>
    <h2>Generative web</h2>
    <p>A more inspiring view reimagines the browser as a tool for generating and transforming web content.</p>
    <p>I’ve seen a few projects over the last few months that hint at these capabilities.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Websim uses the conceit of a browser UI to inspire users to browse the web as it’s imagined by Claude.</li>
        <li>Anthropic has launched Pages which allows anyone to create Wikipedia-style guides. Reminiscent of Hrishi Olickel’s work on Lumentis.</li>
        <li>Max Krieger’s work on Rabbitholes: <a href="https://x.com/maxkriegers/status/1794739768993239134">https://x.com/maxkriegers/status/1794739768993239134</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>What I find most fascinating is the use of generative web content to satisfy complex reasoning tasks.</p>
    <p>These workflows follow a consistent grammar. Drawing on a particular body of content (a set of documents, search results, or web history) and a task description, an assistant generates rich web content.</p>
    <p>Some examples of the sorts of interactions I have in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Convert a PDF into a slide deck efficiently summarizing the main ideas, a set of search results into a spreadsheet, etc.</li>
        <li>Generate a custom catalog based on the backpacks I’ve been looking at recently.</li>
        <li>Generate a document that outlines the key ideas of the articles I’ve read recently.</li>
        <li>What are all the Arxiv papers I’ve looked at in the past week? Can you organize them by category?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A key attribute of these custom workflows is that they’re iterative. The user can perform a single operation (“what are all the backpacks I’ve looked at”) and then iterate to what they want (“remove all backpacks over $200” and “generate a catalog”). This could happen all in a single request or in sequence.</p>
    <p>Some related questions I think about:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If I ask an assistant to generate a slide deck, is the slide deck created in Google Slides or Tome? Or is the slide deck just a universal open non-proprietary format?</li>
        <li>Are there other open non-proprietary components that we might want assistants to utilize for quick-generation? An assistant that generates custom interfaces probably shouldn’t be building a spreadsheet component from scratch.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Beyond the web</h2>
    <p>The more we bake AI-superpowers into the browser, the more likely it becomes that the browser eats up workflows that have nothing to do with the web. A browser that is good at viewing, transforming, and generating various forms of content (hypertext among others) will be a general-purpose application. We’d use it for traditional web content, but we’d also use it for reading ebooks and PDFs or consuming various forms of media living on our local filesystem, etc. The generative browser is really just an AI workspace.</p>
    <p>I wonder if incumbent browsers will be able to pursue this vision. One argument against incumbents is their attachment to existing UX patterns. It’s conceivable that there’s a sort of UX counterpositioning; the incumbents can’t properly embrace these new capabilities without making radical UX changes that would impractically alienate their existing audience. If this were true, that would be a case for optimism for new entrants.</p>
    <p>The radical transformation required to turn the browser into an AI workspace may be the kind of bold product bet that incumbents can’t afford to make.</p>
    <p>Other thoughts on the future of the browser:</p>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
     <div class="footnote" id="footnote1">
        <p>[1] Rabbitholes are a spiritual successor to hyperlinks. Like hyperlinks, rabbitholes connect documents to other documents. But while hyperlinks are predefined connections to documents that already exist, rabbitholes are defined by the end-user at runtime, anchored to any arbitrary selection of content, and prompt the model to generate content on-the-fly.</p>
